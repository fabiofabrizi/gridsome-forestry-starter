## The second moment was Anzio. 

The Allied landings on January 22, 1944, had taken the Wehrmacht completely by surprise, and the road to Rome was literally undefended. Histories of the campaign are filled with criticism of what the Allies did next. They came ashore, apparently relieved at their low casualties, then dug in and sat. Sure, that wasn’t the right thing to do, but in the end, Anzio was not a failure merely because of Allied mistakes or hesitation. It failed, once again, because of the speed of the German reaction. As at Salerno, it was scrambling time. Consider this: the Allies landed at Anzio at 2:00 am. By 3:00, the German operations chief (the “Ia,” in German parlance), Colonel Dietrich Beelitz, awakened Chief of Staff Westphal with news of the landing. Contingency plans were already on the books for a landing near Rome, and Westphal now gave a single code word, “Richard.” 

> By the time Westphal woke up Kesselring and briefed him on developments, at 5:00 am, the machinery was humming.
