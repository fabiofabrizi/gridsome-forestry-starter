## Color Abstracts

**Abstract art** uses [visual language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_language "Visual language") of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art#cite_note-1) [Western art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_art "Western art") had been, from the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance") up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "Perspective (graphical)") and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"), [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science") and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"). The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_art#cite_note-2)

Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art, are closely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.

Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of [imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image "Image") in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible.
